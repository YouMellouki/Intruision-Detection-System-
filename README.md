# Intruision-Detection-System-
ID System attack

The goal of the project is to build an on-stream Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on real time Big data processing technologies.

First, the student should download the KDD dataset1 to be trained by a classification model.

The classification model should be built by using Spark Mlib package.

Next, should prepare a Real time big data environment to analyze the network log files of a selected operating system (Linux, window, Android, â€¦): 
          - Kafka, 
          -Flume, 
          -Dstream , are examples of such environment.
